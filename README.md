# ssp-algorithm-viewer

A visualization learning tool for the shortest path algorithm,
used to compare the differences between different algorithms.

In a specific graph,
it display the **search progress** of different algorithms at the same time,
you can drag the progress bar to control it.

## Supported algorithms

It supports some common algorithms
- BFS
- DFS
- Dijkstra
- Folyd
